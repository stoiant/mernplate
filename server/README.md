## Roadmap

These are the planned updates of the project.

- Nginx server
- ~~PayPal payment~~
- Google login
- ~~Dark theme switch~~
- ~~Material UI v4~~

## Support

## Installation

1. Install dependencies
2. Set env variables
3. Add SSL files
4. Create database

**Install dependencies**

Run <code>npm install</code> at server folder

Run <code>npm install</code> at client folder

**Set env variables - Client**

Create <code>.env.development</code> and <code>.env.production</code> files inside <code>client/</code> folder.

Use port `3002` for development and port `80` for production.

Example (include all of these):

    HOST=0.0.0.0
    PORT=3002
    REACT_APP_HOST=localhost
    REACT_APP_PORT=3001
    SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true
    CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=true

Located at `client/.env.development`.

Note: if you change the ports change them in the dockerfiles too (root, server).

**Set env variables - Server**

Create <code>test.config.env</code>, <code>development.config.env</code> and <code>production.config.env</code> files inside <code>server/.env/</code> folder.

Use port `3001` for test, development and port `80` for production.

Example (include all of these):

    IP=0.0.0.0
    HOST=localhost
    PORT=3001
    CLIENT_HOST=localhost
    CLIENT_PORT=3002
    REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379
    SSL_KEY=[SSL_KEY_FILE_NAME]
    SSL_CRT=[SSL_CRT_FILE_NAME]
    DB_HOST=[MONGOLAB_DB_URL]
    DB_USER=[MONGOLAB_DB_USERNAME]
    DB_PASS=[MONGOLAB_DB_PASSWORD]
    EMAIL_ADDRESS=[GMAIL_ADDRESS]
    EMAIL_PASS=[GMAIL_PASSWORD]
    PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=[PAYPAL_ID]
    PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET=[PAYPAL_SECRET]

Located at `server/.env/development.config.env`.

Note: if you change the ports change them in the dockerfiles too (root, server).

**Add SSL files**

Put your (for example) <code>crt.txt</code> and <code>key.txt</code> files inside <code>server/ssl/</code> folder.

Tip: create them online for free at [ZeroSSL](https://zerossl.com/)

**Create database**

Create MongoDB with a collection called `users`.

I've used the free service provided by [mLab](https://mlab.com/).

**Set up PayPal payment**

1. Create an account at [PayPal Developer](https://developer.paypal.com/`).
2. Create an app, copy the client `ID` and `Secret` to the `.env` files.
3. Create a sandbox account, so you can test the payment.

## Usage

Note: use the following commands at the root folder.

Development

1. Start <code>docker-compose -f docker-compose.development.yml up</code>
2. Go to <code>https://localhost:3001</code> in browser for server
3. Go to <code>http://localhost:3002</code> in browser for client

Production

1. Run <code>npm run build</code>
1. Start <code>docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d</code>
2. Go to <code>https://localhost:80</code> in browser

Note: run `npm rebuild node-sass` inside the client container if asked.

## Docker commands

Using separated docker-compose files for development and production.

**Development**

Start: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.development.yml up`<br>
Stop: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.development.yml down`

**Production**

Start: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up`<br>
Stop: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml down`

## Without docker

You have to set the environment you use in your scripts at `server/package.json`:

    "test": "set NODE_ENV=test&& mocha --exit --reporter spec \"src/*/*.test.js\"",
    "dev": "set NODE_ENV=development&& nodemon app.js -L --exec \"npm run test && npm run lint && node\"",
    "build": "set NODE_ENV=production&& webpack --config webpack.config.js",

Just overwrite the test, dev, build lines with the above.

Development

1. Start <code>npm run dev</code> (or `dev:client` and `dev:server`)
2. Go to <code>https://localhost:3001</code> (server)
3. Go to <code>http://localhost:3002</code> (client)

Production

1. Run <code>npm run build</code>
1. Start <code>npm start</code>
2. Go to <code>https://localhost:80</code>

Note: you may need to install nodemon: <code>npm install nodemon -g</code>

## NPM Scripts

If you prefer not to use docker, you can use the following scripts from the root folder:

**npm run dev**

To use this command, you should install concurrently.<br>
It's prepared, just run `npm install` under the root folder.

**npm run dev:client**

Runs the react client in development mode.<br>
The browser will lint, reload if you make edits.

**npm run dev:server**

Runs the node server in development mode.<br>
The server will test, lint and reload if you make edits.

**npm run build**

Builds the complete application for production to the `build` folder.<br>

**npm start**

Runs the app in production mode with PM2 (cluster mode).

**npm stop**

Stops the application instances in PM2.

**npm run delete**

Removes the application instances from PM2.
